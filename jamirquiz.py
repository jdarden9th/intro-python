#1. What built-in function would you use if you wanted
# to print out data to a user?
#i would use print()

#2. What built-in function would you use if you wanted 
# a user to pass in data to a program?
#i would use input()

#3. Explain what compelity and abstraction are, then 
# provide an example describing their relationship to one another.
# You cannot use the following examples because they 
# were shared in class; grocery/ electronics store, car, phone. 
#abstract in coding is to show strings in different coding ways and compleity is the amount of time 
#the abstract manages the complecity by deleting any uneededinformation  
#5. What is a variable?  
#something that stores data varibles. A+B could be 5+10
#6. Write a function in Python that when called will print out 
# your name. 
#print(f'my name is'(jamir)

#7. What is a function definition and a function call?
#a block code which only works when it is called

#8. Describe what each symbol means?

# = // single equal it means ture or false 
# == // double equal it checks if the values or equal or not 
# != // exclaimation equal it means it is not equal

#9. What will the output for the following code block be?
var1 = 1
var2 = 2
var3 = "3"

print(var1 + var2 + var3)


#10. What will the output for the following code block be?
listOne = [20, 40, 60, 80]
listTwo = [20, 40, 60, 80]

print(listOne == listTwo)

# 11. Create the following python lists and include the following
# data types for each list:
# a- create a python list of strings. The strings should be items you
# can find in a book bag.
# b- Create a python list of floats. the floats should represent the 
# price of each item in a book bag from the previous list.

# 12. What are the Three (3) naming formats we use for naming variables, files, and functions?
#carmel case, snake case, pascal case,
# 13. Provide a coding scenario where you would you use a comparison operator in a program?
#when we compare x==y
# 14. Provide a coding scenario Where you would you use a logical operator in a program?
#x>0 and x<10
# 15. Create a block of code where you would 
# use a comparison operator with the follwing data:
currentScore= 100
highScore=2300

# Bonus : What does the type() function do? it returnes any stored data
